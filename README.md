##🌦️ Weather Data Visualization in Python

This project is a Python-based weather visualization tool that retrieves and displays the current temperature and humidity for a specified city using the wttr.in API. The data is visualized using a clean bar chart created with **Matplotlib and Seaborn.

---

## 📌 Features

- 📡 Fetches real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, and description)
- 📊 Generates visual bar charts for quick insights
- 💡 Clean and simple code structure, easy to modify for different cities
- 🛡️ Robust error handling for network issues and unexpected responses
- ✅ No API key required (uses open-source wttr.in)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-visualization.git
cd weather-visualization

2. Install Dependencies
